# Clean up after yourself
One of the great things about computers is that you don't have to delete anything
you can write the same shell script 100 times with 100 different names and keep
them all. But just like your garage, the more things you save, the harder it is
to really find what you need. So, when you realize that your clever directory
just for scripts that help with parsing log files is totally unused, take a few
minutes to look through and see if any of them are generally useful, and delete
any that aren't. Then delete the folder. Do this often and things will generally
stay pretty organized.

# Periodic Purge
Sometimes you will change gears and leave behind vast archives of started work.
You so completely leave it behind that you don't even remember you've left it.
So, every few months, or once a year, seek these out and delete them. You can
tell which files are totally worthless pretty quick usually. Delete the
obviously worthless files first, then go back later and you will find that
some of the others seem totally worthless, and soon all of your files are
interesting.

# Empty your trash
I know it can be scary, but after a big purge, empty your trash. Once this is
done, there is no point wondering if you delted something you need, you can't
get it back anyway.

P.S. - It is not lost on me that after I cleaned house, I wrote a new file
about it.
