title: give developers beer

An at work happy hour gets people talking, one or two beers will keep them from worrying about what is important to say and they just say whatever they are thinking. Companies that don't have the social thing down are not doing it right, the onus of communication is not so much on the individual as it is on the organization itself. If you tell somebody that they need to share what they've found, you need to also tell everybody else to listen to what they've shared. If you give some folks a ton of free beer, they will find out what the other people will find out what they've been up to.
